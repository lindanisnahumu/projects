	  <p>Iris is a genus of 260â€“300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers. It takes its
	  name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of
	  the rainbow, Iris. Some authors state that the name refers to the wide variety of 
	  flower colors found among the many species. As well as being the scientific name, iris
	  is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to
	  other closely related genera. A common name for some species is 'flags', while the 
	  plants of the subgenus Scorpiris are widely known as 'junos', particularly in 
	  horticulture. It is a popular garden flower.</p>
	  
	  <p>The often-segregated, monotypic genera Belamcanda (blackberry lily, I. domestica), 
	  Hermodactylus (snake's head iris, I. tuberosa), and Pardanthopsis (vesper iris, I. 
	  dichotoma) are currently included in Iris.</p>

	  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy)"><img src="../images/iris2.jpg" height="200" width="250" alt="Iris(anatomy)" title="iris(anatomy)"></a>In humans and most mammals and birds, the iris (plural: irides or irises) is a thin, annular structure in the eye, responsible for controlling the diameter and size of the pupil, thus the amount of light reaching the retina. Eye color is defined by that of the iris. In optical terms, the pupil is the eye's aperture, while the iris is the diaphragm.</p>
      
	  <h2>Structure</h2>
	  <p>The iris consists of two layers: the front pigmented fibrovascular layer known as 
	  a stroma and, beneath the stroma, pigmented epithelial cells.</p>
	  
      <p>The stroma is connected to a sphincter muscle (sphincter pupillae), which contracts
	  the pupil in a circular motion, and a set of dilator muscles (dilator pupillae), which
	  pull the iris radially to enlarge the pupil, pulling it in folds.</p>
	  
      <p>The sphincter pupillae is the opposing muscle of the dilator pupillae. The pupil's 
	  diameter, and thus the inner border of the iris, changes size when constricting or 
	  dilating. The outer border of the iris does not change size. The constricting muscle 
	  is located on the inner border.</p>

	  <p>The Technical, Entrepreneurial and Vocational Education and Training
        (TEVET) Act of 1999 and revised TEVET Policy of 2013 promote Competence
        Based Education and Training (CBET) approach in provision of TEVET in
        Malawi. The approach is standard based, modular and has a system of
        continuous and summative assessment. The competence standards are
        developed by the industry. TEVET provider institutions are expected to
        deliver training according to the expected level of performance set by
        the industry.
        This training package contains training modules. A training module is
        composed of one or more learning outcomes derived from nationally
        vetted competence standards. It outlines principles and practices
       involved in the delivery and assessment of competencies for the award
       of a qualification in Information and Communication Technology Level
       3 of the TEVET Qualifications Framework. It is also intended to assist trainers
      to develop relevant instructional and assessment materials.
      A qualification will be awarded upon successful accumulation of all 78
     credits in Occupational Modules, 42 credits in Fundamental Modules and
     a pass in the summative assessment.
     Caution must be exercised to avoid rushing through the modules with
     the aim of getting learners complete the module before full mastery of
     the stipulated skills.
     Elements of modules and performance criteria given in this package
     indicate the performance levels acceptable to the industry and are
     nationally consistent. Arbitrary modifications on any part of the Training
   Package are not allowed</p>
